# Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay.

# Enter Hours: 35
# Enter Rate: 2.75
# Pay: 96.25
# We won't worry about making sure our pay has exactly two digits after the decimal place for now. If you want, you can play with the built-in Python round function to properly round the resulting pay to two decimal places.

# Program:

hours = input('Enter Hours: ')
rate = input('Enter Rate: ')
pay = int(hours) * float(rate)
print('Pay: ', pay)

# Output:
# PS C:\> python.exe '.\Exercise 3.py'
# Enter Hours: 35
# Enter Rate: 2.75
# Pay:  96.25
